# MARS6: A Small & Robust Hierarchical-Codec Text-to-Speech Model

**MARS6** is a compact autoregressive TTS system based on a hierarchical neural audio codec. It uses a two-stage decoder to predict coarse-to-fine tokens at only **12 Hz**, leading to fast inference while preserving high audio quality and speaker similarity. MARS6 achieves robust zero-shot voice cloning and expressive synthesis even on challenging in-the-wild references. This repository provides a lightweight implementation for inference using our public turbo checkpoints.

## Model Architecture

Below is a high-level diagram of MARS6 from our paper. The encoder processes the text and speaker embeddings (from an external speaker encoder), producing a sequence of latent features. The hierarchical decoder operates at a low 12 Hz "global" level while autoregressively expanding each frame into multiple discrete codec tokens with a small "local" decoder.

## Quick Start Guide

This section outlines how to install and run MARS6 for inference. You can either clone this repository and install dependencies or load MARS6 directly via Torch Hub.

### Installation

You can install MARS6 in two ways:

#### Option 1: Direct Installation from GitHub

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/Camb-ai/mars6-turbo.git
```
or using pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Camb-ai/mars6-turbo.git
```

#### Option 2: Local Development Installation

1. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Camb-ai/mars6-turbo.git
   cd mars6
   ```

2. **Install in editable mode**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

Both methods will automatically install all required dependencies. The package requires Python 3.8+.

### Usage

After installation, you can use MARS6 in two ways:

#### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage (using an audio file as reference)
mars6 --audio path/to/reference.wav --text "Hello, this is a test of the Mars6 TTS end to end voice cloning system." --save_path output.wav

# Example using the included sample audio
# First, download example.wav from the repository's assets folder
mars6 --audio example.wav --text "Hello, this is a test of the Mars6 TTS end to end voice cloning system." --save_path output.wav

# Advanced usage with deep cloning
mars6 \
    --audio assets/example.wav \
    --text "Hello, this is a test of the Mars6 TTS end to end voice cloning system." \
    --save_path output.wav \
    --device cuda \
    --deep_clone_mode per-chunk \
    --transcript "Optional: provide the transcript of the reference audio for better cloning"
```

The CLI tool will use CUDA if available, otherwise fall back to CPU.

#### Python Package

```python
from mars6 import inference

# See example.py for complete usage example
```

For interactive usage, you can also use the [`MARS6_turbo_inference_demo.ipynb`](MARS6_turbo_inference_demo.ipynb) notebook.
